- We have added a new sections in the program. 

The Random Battle selects two characters and it creates random numbers (hp, intelligence,...) through Math library. 

The Custom Battle takes the datas that the usuary introduces. These datas are stored in auxiliar instances. If the usuary introduces a data wrong, the program will are closed.

The View Character Mode must show a list with characters that are created and saved by the usuary. These datas are saved in a csv. If you select the option 4, you can create a new character.

The methods information show a character's description from the battle starts to the battle finishes. Round by round.

Some sounds are reproduced during the battle. To iniciate the program, the battle and weak attack and strong attack of the wizard. For this reason, there is a pause method where the program pauses between three or five seconds.

If the battle is ended, you can save the character that you create it at the beggining.

The battle can repeat at most five times. We avoid that the computer is compiling a large time.
